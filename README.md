# Password-Strength-Analyser

This is a basic Password Strength Analyser which creates a value based on the complexity (lower, upper characters, digits, and special characters), and on the length of the password. 
A higher value implies a 'stronger' password.

This is my first python "project" (if one could call this one), with use of online tools to assist me. This project is just for basic practice and understanding of python and its use in cybersecurity.

However, in a future update I wish to increase the value a longer passwords provides as, for example, a passphrase of pillowfacemonkeybeeswax, a total of 23 characters long, would be a more secure password than @2Fhbn7. Despite this, according to my password checking would score lower than the more complex password example [1].



## Future Updates

- Identifying consecuential numbers 
- Repeating numbers
- Dates
